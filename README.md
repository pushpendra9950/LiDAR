Point clouds are distributed spatial coordinates that can resemble a particular object or a shape when assembled. They feature important applications in domains like autonomous vehicles, terrain modeling, drone navigation, etc. However, unlike their 3D mesh counterpart, point clouds are independently distributed points in space. Thus our CNN network needs to ignore the permutation changes and the corresponding rigid body transformations.
